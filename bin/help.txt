Luchok is a Fantasy Console inspired by Chip-8 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8).
The games for Luchok are written in Lua. (I prefer the .luchok extension, but the engine does not care).

Every frame (60 per second) the function vblank() is called.

The API for the fantasy console is:

    cls() - clears the screen.
    draw(sprite, x, y) - draw the array sprite at x (0-63) and y (0-31).
    draw(sprite, x, y, start, len) - draw the array sprite (len (0-31) bytes starting from index start) at x (0-63) and y (0-31).
    rnd(limit) - generate a random integer from 0 to limit (0-255).
    key_pressed(num) - check if the specified key (0-15) is pressed at this frame.
    key_released(num) - check if the specified key (0-15) has been released.
    bcd(num) - splits the specified number (0-255), into array of its digits
    get_sprite(num) - gets the built-in sprite for the specified number (0-255)
    delay_timer (0-255) - decrements every frame until it hits 0
    sound_timer (0-255) - decrements every frame until it hits 0, each frame it's not 0 a buzzer sounds
